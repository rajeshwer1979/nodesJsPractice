All dependencies are listed in a "package.json" file
NPM scripts can be created to run certain tasks such as run a server

npm init                --> Generates a package.json file
npm install express     --> Installs a package locally
npm install -g nodemon  --> Installs a package globally

//Node Modules :-
Node Core Modules (path, fs, http, etc)
3rd party modules/packages installed via NPM
